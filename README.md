# Supply Chain Network Optimisation

## Repository Overview

Welcome to the Supply Chain Network Optimisation repository! This repository contains Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts designed to solve classic supply chain optimisation problems, including Transportation and Transhipment Problems. Our focus is to leverage Python and its powerful libraries to formulate, solve, and analyse these network models, providing a robust and flexible alternative to traditional Excel-based solutions.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organised into the following sections:

### 1. Transportation Problem
- **Introduction**: An overview of the Transportation Problem, including problem definition, constraints, and objective function.
- **Model Formulation**: Detailed steps to formulate the problem using linear programming techniques.
- **Python Implementation**: Jupyter notebooks illustrating the implementation of the Transportation Problem using Python, including data input, model setup, and solution extraction.

### 2. Transhipment Problem
- **Introduction**: An overview of the Transhipment Problem, highlighting the differences and additional complexities compared to the Transportation Problem.
- **Model Formulation**: This is a comprehensive guide to formulating the Transhipment Problem, with a focus on network flows and additional constraints.
- **Python Implementation**: Jupyter Notebooks showcasing the Python-based approach to solving the Transhipment Problem, complete with code snippets and detailed explanations.

### 3. Modelling Approaches and Insights
- **Trade-offs and Insights**: Discussion on the trade-offs involved in network optimisation, including cost minimisation, capacity constraints, and demand satisfaction.
- **Optimisation Techniques**: Exploration of various optimisation techniques and their applicability to different types of network problems.
